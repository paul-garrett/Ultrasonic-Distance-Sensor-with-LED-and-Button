# Ultrasonic-Distance-Sensor-with-LED-and-Button
Raspberry Pi project of an Ultrasonic Distance Sensor with LED and Button 

I have created a model of an Ultrasonic Distance Sensor with a button to activate the sensor portion along with an LED to light up once a certain distance has been reached. 

Code will be written in Python.

Physical pictures of the Raspberry Pi setup are provided, along with a tinkercad diagram.
